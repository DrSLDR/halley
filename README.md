# Halley

An offsite backup manager, using [restic](https://restic.net/)

## ToDo

First plan of action:

* [ ] Wrapper around Restic
  * [x] Presence - Ensuring restic is installed
  * [x] Init - Creating a repository
  * [x] Backup - Creating a snapshot and putting it in a repo
  * [ ] Forget - Filtering snapshots that are too old
  * [ ] Prune - Actually binning unused data
  * [ ] Stats - Getting repository statistics, for logging
* [x] Scaffolding to talk to S3

Later on:
* [ ] A CLI
  * [ ] ~~Can write a default config file to a given location~~

    Nope, due to limitations in the `toml` serializer, that won't be possible.

  * [ ] Can validate a config
  * [ ] Can start, given a config file
    * [ ] Can dry run
    * [ ] Can run a specific repository
* [ ] Configuration file handling
  * [x] Can open and read a file
  * [x] Understand S3 details
  * [x] Understand one or more repositories
  * [x] Allow globbing in repository paths
  * [ ] Also want to define:
    * [ ] S3Handler internal settings
    * [ ] Retention policies
    * [ ] Defaults for all repositories
    * [ ] Maybe possibly Deep Magicâ„¢ restic settings
* [ ] Scheduling (or whatever we'll call that)
